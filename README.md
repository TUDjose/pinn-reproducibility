# PINN Blogpost

In this blog post we attempt to reproduce the paper *Solving real-world optimization tasks using physics-informed neural computing*[^X].
We reproduce three of the examples produced in the paper by implementing the network in pure PyTorch, and include a [new example](#spaceship-landing) in order to further test the capabilities if the proposed architecture.


## Pendulum

## Spacecraft Swingby

## Shortest Path

## Spaceship Landing
